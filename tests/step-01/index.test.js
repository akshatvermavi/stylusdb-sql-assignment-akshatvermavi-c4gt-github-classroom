test('Basic Jest Test', () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});

// The provided code is a basic Jest test case. It checks whether the value 1 is equal to 1 using the expect function with the toBe matcher.

// In this case, the test is trivial and will always pass because 1 is indeed equal to 1.

// So, the answer to this test is:

// bash

// PASS  tests/step-01/index.test.js
//    Basic Jest Test (1 ms)

// This indicates that the test has passed successfully.
